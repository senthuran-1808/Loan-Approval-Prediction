# Loan-Approval-Prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict loan approval based on various applicant factors such as gender, married status, propert area, income, credit history, and employment status. By leveraging a dataset containing loan applicant information, the goal is to use different classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to identify which model yields the most accurate predictions for loan approval.
